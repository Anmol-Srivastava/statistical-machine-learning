    "1. You are a farmer looking to understand how your annual potato yield is affected by the environment on your farm, so that you can continue to increase your potato sales and (subsequently) income. There is annual data that describes the environment through such predictors as: average inches of rainfall, average amounts of pesticide used, and a categorical variable describing your soil quality as fair, good, or bad. The response is a numeric quantity (say, in KG) of your potato yield. Using regression, the past data can help you determine which of these features matter in the context of yield, and how. While this information can help you predict yield by substituting new predictor values, you are really interested with learning how potato growth depends on soil, rain, and temperature -- to then make better decisions, not predictions. So, this is an inference scenario.  \n",

    "2. Suppose a company wants to be able to predict monetary losses caused by the crashing of their servers, which has happened in the past. They have collected data from past crashes. The predictors are: how many of their servers went down, how long they went down, and the temperature in the server room. The response is the loss in revenue from the time the servers went down, to the time they all came back up. A regression model built on this data could help the company simulate a unique server shutdown, and predict the losses that would result. Let the company be less interested in exactly how minute changes in temperature (or shutdown length) impacts loss. Their interest is chiefly in forecasting losses as accurately as possible -- therefore, this application would be primarily prediction-oriented. \n",
